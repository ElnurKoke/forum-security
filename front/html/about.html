            Welcome to our web forum! Here, registered users can create posts and comments, associating them with categories of their choice. They can also like or dislike posts and comments, with the number of likes and dislikes visible to all. Additionally, users can filter posts by categories, those they've created, or those they've liked. Join us and engage in meaningful discussions today!

            When you sign up for the forum, your username, email address, and password are checked to make sure they follow certain rules. Your username must be between 6 and 36 characters long and contain only letters and numbers. Your email address must be correct, and your password must be between 8 and 20 characters long and include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character, like ! or @. If anything doesn't meet these rules, you'll get an error message and can fix your input before continuing with the registration.

        </p>     
            When registering on the forum, you can also choose to sign up using your Google or GitHub account. This means you don't have to create a separate username and password for the forum if you already have an account with Google or GitHub. Just click on the respective button for Google or GitHub registration, and you'll be redirected to their login page. After signing in with your Google or GitHub credentials, you'll be automatically registered and logged in to the forum. This simplifies the registration process and provides an alternative way to access the forum without creating a new account from scratch.

            If you have successfully registered, you can always create your own post. You will also have a new opportunity to leave comments on the posts of other users and put your like or dislike there.
            When creating a post, you need to fill out all the required fields, including the image for the post (in PNG, JPEG, GIF format).
            In the future, you can edit or delete your posts and comments.
